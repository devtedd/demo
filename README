Hapi Skeleton Application

The idea of this application is to provide a good base application that I can use for building further applications on top of.

Providing only the very basics.

This app is installed on heroku at https://immense-forest-4171.herokuapp.com/

#TODO list
set up dev and heroku config to switch between mongolabs and local mongo database, based on the best practice blog on heroku
set up a view engine, react, angular, handlebars?

set up hapi error handling.

Stuff to prototype
#react templating
#authentication
